## üíª Technology Stack

Our chosen stack combines the best of modern development for a powerful and flexible application:

*   **Frontend (GUI): Flutter (Language: Dart)**
    *   **Justification:** Provides a fantastic UI/UX, native performance, true cross-platform capabilities (desktop, web, future mobile), and results in a reasonably sized executable.
*   **Backend (Core Logic & API): Python (with Flask/FastAPI)**
    *   **Justification:** Leverages Python's unbeatable ecosystem for AI and data processing. Existing logic (Gemini API calls, OCR processing) can be directly reused. Flask/FastAPI provides a robust local REST API for communication with Flutter.
*   **Packaging:** PyInstaller (for Python backend) + Native Installer Tools (NSIS for Windows, pkgbuild/DMG for macOS, etc. for bundling Flutter and Python together).
    *   **Justification:** Enables a unified, "one-click" installation experience for the end-user.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
    *   **Justification:** Automates cross-platform builds and GitHub Releases on tag pushes, ensuring consistent and timely updates.
*   **Local Database:** SQLite
    *   **Justification:** Lightweight, serverless, and perfect for managing project data, glossaries, and translation history directly on the user's machine.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### For End-Users (Coming Soon!)

We are actively working on providing native installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Our goal is a "one-click wonder" experience where you simply download, install, and run the application. Stay tuned for official releases!

### For Developers

If you wish to contribute or run the application from source, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.8+:** Make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH.
*   **Flutter SDK:** Follow the official Flutter installation guide for your operating system.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **(Optional for OCR functionality):** Tesseract OCR (and its language data) will be required later for image-to-text translation.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered-lore-translator.git
cd ai-powered-lore-translator

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Markdown
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
2. Backend Setup (Python)

Navigate to the project root and set up the Python environment:

      
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install backend dependencies (Flask/FastAPI, Google-Gemini, etc.)
pip install -r requirements.txt # (You'll need to create this file with your dependencies)

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
3. Frontend Setup (Flutter)

Navigate to the Flutter project directory (e.g., flutter_app if you choose to separate it, or directly in root if combined):

      
# Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

    

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
Use code with caution. Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
4. Configure API Key

You will need a Google Gemini API Key.
Create or open config/app_config.json and add your API key:

      
{
    "api_key": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE",

    Full Collaborative Platform (Backend): Implement a dedicated server for real-time, seamless collaborative translation efforts.

üöß Key Challenges & Considerations

Developing a cross-platform desktop application with a dual-language stack involves unique complexities:

    Dual Language Development: Managing development across Dart (Flutter) and Python (Backend).

    Inter-Process Communication: Reliably starting and managing the Python service from the Flutter app and facilitating communication via a local REST API.

    Complex Packaging: Creating unified installers for each OS that bundle both the Flutter application and the Python service seamlessly.

    API Key Security: Implementing secure storage for the Gemini API key (e.g., using keyring or encryption).

    OCR Dependencies: Managing and packaging external OCR dependencies (like Tesseract and its language data).

    Threading & Asynchronicity: Ensuring the UI remains responsive during long-running operations (API calls, OCR processing).

    Robust Error Handling: Providing user-friendly error messages for the non-technical target audience.

    Real-time Collaboration: The most complex feature, likely requiring a dedicated remote backend infrastructure.
